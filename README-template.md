## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to scale image to fill the content box while maintaining its aspect ratio and cropping any parts that overflow, using the CSS properties object-fit(object-fit: cover; to scale and crop image overflow) and object position(object-position: center; to make sure the image is centered after resizing). This is to make the image responsive as specified in the design.
- How to use the css clamp() function to reduce and increase the font sizes for different screen resolutions and make text responsive without media queries.
- Making a flexbox container responsive using flex-grow and flex-shrink, with flex-basis as the base width
